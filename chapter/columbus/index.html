<p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research publication with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, learn, and discuss.</p>

<p>Unlike many chapters, we generally meet informally over lunch instead of having slideshow presentations in the evening. Sometimes we read papers; other weeks we discuss chapters from programming books. You can check out our <a href="https://trello.com/b/zUg556Fs/papers-we-love-columbus">reading backlog</a>.</p>

<p>We'll be using <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">papers-we-love's curated repository</a>. Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.</p>

<p>PWL Columbus strictly adheres to the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a> set forth by all PWL charters.</p>

          <p>Come have lunch with Papers We Love and enjoy good food and geeky talk. We'll be discussing the paper "Gray Failure: The Achilles’ Heel of Cloud-Scale Systems," from Microsoft Research. In it, the authors note that the most common failure scenario in cloud-scale systems is not hard failure, but soft failures, which may be only partially detectable, and are much harder to compensate for:</p> <p>"Cloud scale provides the vast resources necessary to replace failed components, but this is useful only if those failures can be detected. For this reason, the major availability breakdowns and performance anomalies we see in cloud environments tend to be caused by subtle underlying faults, i.e., gray failure rather than fail-stop failure. In this paper, we discuss our experiences with gray failure in production cloud-scale systems to show its broad scope and consequences."</p> <p>You can get a free copy of the paper here: </p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/265273996/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Quantum computers with[masked] qubits may be able to perform tasks which surpass the capabilities of today's classical digital computers, but noise in quantum gates will limit the size of quantum circuits that can be executed reliably. NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-body quantum physics, and may have other useful applications, but the 100-qubit quantum computer will not change the world right away --- we should regard it as a significant step toward the more powerful quant…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/263764777/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published _New Directions in Cryptography,_ a paper which introduced public key encryption and what would be later termed Diffie Hellman Key Exchange to the general public. For their efforts, they were rewarded with an immediate threat of jail, and, later, the ACM Turing Award.</p> <p>You can read [the original paper](<a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf" class="linkified">https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf</a>) as well as [this article about [the NSA's attempt to suppress this paper](<a href="https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=74801" class="linkified">https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=74801</a>).</p> <p>There's a bit of math in the middle of the paper, but feel free to skip it if you like.

          <p>For our next lunchtime informal paper discussion, we'll talk about the paper "<a href="http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/isr2010/CMU-ISR-10-104.pdf">Coordination Breakdowns &amp; their Impact on Development Productivity &amp; Failures</a>," by Marcelo Cataldo and James D. Herbsleb.</p> <p>The paper uses empirical review of two large scale software projects to analyze a proposition that changing the way that teams are organized can have a positive effect on overall project productivity by reducing friction due to dependencies, and finds evidence in the affirmative.</p> <p>Here's part of the abstract.</p> <p>"The success of software development projects depends on carefully and effectively coordinating the effort of many individuals across the multiple stages of the development process. In software engineering, modularization is the traditional technique intended to reduce the interdependencies among modules that constitute a system.

          <p>We're going to start discussing a new book, The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Volume II. Most reviews seem to indicate that it's the best of the series. You can <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/index.html">read the book for free online</a> or <a href="https://github.com/aosabook/aosabook/tree/master/v2">download electronic versions, also free</a>. If you choose to <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#vol2">buy the book</a>, the profits go to Amnesty International.</p> <p>Since I'm super-late in scheduling this, there is no chapter assignment.

          <p>Our meetings always get a little spotty around the holidays. We've decided not to have a meeting on Thanksgiving day, for obvious reasons, so the next meeting is going to be on 7 December at 11:30 a.m., when we'll discuss "<a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~dcm/Teaching/COT4810-Fall%202012/Literature/Backus.pdf">Can Programming Be Liberated from the Von Neumann Style?</a>" (free PDF link) by John Backus.</p> <p>It's an interesting paper for many reasons: Are you programming in "the Von Neumann style?" What are the alternatives? Backus presents a notion of "functional programming" which is decidedly different than how many people use that phrase.</p> <p>At 30 or so pages, this paper is a bit longer than the others we've read, but it's also considerably more technical. If you find the algebra in the middle a bit much, you can get the general sense of the paper by reading sections 1-10 and 15-16 and skipping the rest. The full paper is worth reading, but please don't let the math drive y…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/245327938/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>Important</b>: We're skipping 26 October. Our next meetup is on 9 November, with a new paper!</p> <p>On our next lunch meetup, we're going to discuss <i><a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43146.html">Machine Learning: The High Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt</a></i>, an interesting paper from a team of Google researchers demonstrating that use of machine learning has many costs as well as benefits. Beyond having one of the catchier titles in the history of computer science papers, the paper will keep your attention from beginning to end, an easy read with a great summary of real world experience maintaining large machine learning systems.</p> <p>Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex systems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level whe…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/tcnwxmywpbmb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Online tax preparation or financial advice sounds like a viable business, but "secure" sites are broken every day. Consumers are rightly wary of disclosing their personal information to cloud-based service providers. How can you build a service which delivers real value and is backed by a hard, cryptographic guarantee of security?</p> <p>What if it were possible for a customer to give their data to a cloud provider in encrypted form, and for that provider to perform useful computations on that data without ever decrypting it? The results would be delivered to the customer, encrypted with a key that only they knew. It sounds like an ideal solution, but maybe impossible?</p> <p>This is the promise of homomorphic encryption. The idea has been around for some time, but it was considered intriguing but maybe not possible until Craig Gentry's groundbreaking thesis. Gentry later published a much more accessible paper called "Computing Arbitrary Functions of Encrypted Data".</p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/220427574/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

The premise of the paper is certainly ambitious: Explain why developing and maintaining large software systems is hard, and how to fix it. </p> <p>Amazingly, this 10 year old paper mostly delivers. Perhaps even more surprisingly, however, its clear explanation, high citation count, and relatively straightforward prescription for dealing with complexity have not translated into a correspondingly large influence on mainstream programming tools and frameworks (with certain notable exceptions, such as the Clojure community). </p> <p>In a sense, then, reading the paper informs us not only of the authors' strategy for building large, maintainable systems, but of our own community's ability to digest useful b…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/189943332/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Please bring along a copy of a paper you've enjoyed to give away, and you can leave with a copy of someone else's favorite!</p> <p>I'll try to organize food if enough people RSVP. </p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/187569892/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
