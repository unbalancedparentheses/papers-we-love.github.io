          <p>"Scalability! But at What COST?" and "Naiad: A Timely Dataflow System"</p> <p>In this talk, we'll look at two papers, "Scalability! But at What COST?" and "Naiad: A Timely Dataflow System". Many of the observations and arguments from "Scalability! But at What COST?" were motivated by the authors' experience of working on Naiad. Naiad's timely dataflow model has since been ported to Rust, where it sees active development.</p> <p>Scalability! But at What COST?</p> <p>Distributed data processing systems often aim to provide "scalability", offering users the ability to accelerate computations by taking advantage of many machines. But building a scalable system introduces significant overheads, and many systems force programmers into restricted programming models that make it hard to use efficient algorithms. In "Scalability! But at What COST?", McSherry et al. argue that researchers should measure the COST (Configuration that Outperforms a Single Thread) of their scalable systems.</p> &lt;… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/265166051/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Often the relation between two designs is that one is a transformation of another. When we understand how to mechanically transform designs, we can more easily explore the design space, and effortlessly identify the tradeoffs.</p> <p>So, what do these design changes have in common?</p> <p>- Letting a search procedure take an arbitrary filter function, instead of a fixed set of options</p> <p>- Changing a program using blocking I/O to non-blocking I/O with an event loop</p> <p>- Letting a user stop in the middle of an action — and resume it after a server reboot</p> <p>Answer: They’re all instances of a transformation called “defunctionalization” or its inverse, “refunctionalization.” Come learn how it works, and learn to recognize when a proposed design change is just an instance of …</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/263029508/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Many messaging systems that are widely used in the industry, e.g., Kafka, use centralized distributed systems services to achieve reliability and consensus between servers. Companies in the industry use the services; however, only a few of them understand the details of the protocols. This talk brings the principles used in academia to the industry by introducing the common distributed systems protocols implemented underneath the popular services. In addition, this talk will compare the differences between how the protocols are used in both academia and the industry. It provides details of how the protocols, specifically Paxos and Raft, work, including how they elect leaders among servers, how they achieve consensus between machines, and how they reliability process and execute client commands. Therefore, it shows how the systems and services, which use the protocols, are enabled to have fault-tolerance, and to achieve confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, availability, etc. Fro…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/254237988/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>The early 2000's saw several research groups look into distributed hash tables as a decentralized way to structure a distributed system. In this talk, I'll briefly describe some of the history behind DHTs, and look at one of them in particular: Pastry, which takes into account how close or far apart nodes are from each other when constructing the peer-to-peer overlay network. We'll also look at Scribe, which implements anycast/multicast messaging on top of the Pastry overlay network.</p> <p>Papers:</p> <p>A. Rowstron and P.

          <p>Niko Matsakis, one of the core Rust contributors, is going to present some proof techniques from Prolog that are informing some advanced work in Rust's type checker and compiler.</p> <p>Traditional Prolog lets you define logical relationships and then have the solver figure out the inferences. But Prolog's Horn Clauses are fairly simplistic in terms of what they can express. This paper talks about a few relatively simple techniques that lets us extend to a much richer logic, supporting things like proving that one statement implies another, or proving "for all" predicates. So for example where Prolog could perhaps setup rules to decide when `hungry(joe)` is true or `hungry(nancy)`, this technique describes techniques to prove `hungry(P)` is true for *any* person P.</p> <p>"A proof procedure for the logic of hereditary Harrop formulas", Gopalan Nadathur, Journal of Automated Reasoning, Feb 1993, 11(1), pp[masked].</p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/250646818/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Why are we still using languages like Java or C++ for these sorts of tasks?

Firstly, we give a general discussion of the design issues involved in implementing non-strict functional languages.</p> <p>Next, we present the <i>STG language</i>, an austere but recognisably-functional language, which as well as a <i>denotational</i> meaning has a well-defi ned <i>operational</i> semantics. The STG language is the "abstract machine code" for the Spineless Tagless G-machine.</p> <p>Lastly, we discuss the mapping of the STG language onto stock hardware.

          <p>Godel's Incompleteness Theorems are among the most famous results in modern mathematics.  They are often informally stated as follows:</p> <p>1. Any formal system that can express elementary arithmetic contains statements that are "true but not provable".</p> <p>2. Any consistent formal system that can express elementary arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency.</p> <p>These informal statements, however, often raise more questions than they answer.  What exactly is a "formal system"? What does it mean for a statement to be "true but not provable"?  What does it mean to "express arithmetic", and why does arithmetic have anything to do with proof or consistency?</p> <p>This talk will introduce the audience to the main ideas behind the incompleteness theorems.  We'll discuss the historical context in which the incompleteness theorems were discovered, develop the concepts necessary to properly understand what the theorems actually say, and present a sketch of the theorems' proof.</p>… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/237933920/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>"You are not expected to understand this." That is the now famous comment in UNIX v6's process switching (swtch) code. Process switching -- and multitasking more generally -- is a neat magic trick the OS pulls off. It's a delicate dance between the operating system and the hardware. We will dig into how this dance works on UNIX v6 and the PDP11, including the famous comment. We will also look into how the process switching magic happens on a more recent OS and CPU architecture (FreeBSD on x86). It should be a fun trip down the rabbit hole of operating system kernels internals and instruction set specifications</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/235786123/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>An oversimplified history of CSP</b></p> <p>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) was first described by Tony Hoare in 1978.  Since then, there have been two main "branches" of further development.  In the first branch, CSP inspired how concurrency is handled in an ongoing series of programming languages — most recently (and famously) in Go.  In the second branch, CSP was refined into a rigorous "process calculus", and has since been used to formally prove various safety and liveness properties of concurrent and distributed systems.</p> <p>This talk will be a whirlwind history of CSP, a high-level overview of the process calculus, and some live demos of using a refinement checker to prove things about interesting systems.  (No proving things by hand!)</p> <p>CAR Hoare.  "<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-3472-0_16">Communicating Sequential Processes</a>", CACM 21(8), pp. [masked], 1978.</p> <p>CAR Hoare.  <a href="http://www.usingcsp.com/"><i>Communi…</i></a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/234829295/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Have you ever wished GUI tools for building visuals like PowerPoint and Illustrator had a more programming-like interface for making similar images rather than copying, pasting, and tweaking all the time? Have you ever wished programmatic systems like LaTeX and Processing.js allowed you to just click and drag on items in the output to change the result, rather than going through an edit-compile-run cycle every time? In some of the latest research, you can have both!</p> <p>In this talk, Jon Schuster will discuss "Programmatic and Direct Manipulation, Together at Last" [1] from this year's PLDI (Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation).
