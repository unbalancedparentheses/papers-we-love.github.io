They were originally presented as an alternative to Google's TrueTime, a proprietary timekeeping mechanism in Spanner DB based on atomic clocks for totally ordering transactions. HLC works well for partially ordering events in a distributed system, as well as rooting them in wall-clock time, something that Lamport clocks, vector clocks &amp; co. don't do. Several distributed databases have implemented Hybrid Logical Clocks, such as MongoDB, Couchbase, CockroachDB and Yugabyte.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Montreal/events/265073175/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Programming is closely related to abstraction and we can use some of the ideas in this field to write better programs. This paper will bring some concepts of modern algebra categorized by Noether, such as many types of rings, groups and others. After a set of definitions, we will see an example of an application in code (in Python, Ruby, Haskell or Scala).</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Montreal/events/243920859/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert will present Soman and Krintz's paper, "<a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/papers/osr.pdf">Efficient and General On-Stack Replacement for Aggressive Program Specialization</a>".  Maxime had the following to say about the paper:</p> <p>"On-stack replacement is a technique used in almost every modern JIT. Java JITs, JavaScript JITs, etc. It's still very relevant to JIT compiler design, but it's something you may not learn about in a compiler class. The technique was pioneered in Self, but I thought this paper is best, because the Self paper introducing it also introduces a half-dozen other optimizations, which would just confuse the discussion."</p> <p>I am very excited about having an interesting compiler paper presented at PWLMTL, and I'm sure all you compiler design afficionados will enjoy this one.  For those who don't think they're interested in compilers, consider how insight into JIT optimizations can help you reason about the performance of all…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Montreal/events/223605623/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
