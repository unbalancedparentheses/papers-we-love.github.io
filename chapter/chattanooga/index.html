That’s right: people. Lazy, unkempt, indecisive people, just waiting to make your beautiful functions useless. Join us as we explore the state of the art in machines not really learning what we think they’re learning, probably because of something we did.</p> <p>This talk is more of a survey than a deep dive into a single paper, but a couple papers that go into detail on some methods we’ll explore toward the end of the talk (spoiler alert) are:<br>- Unmasking Clever Hans Predictors and Assessing What Machines Really Learn: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10178.pdf" class="linkified">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10178.pdf</a><br>- AllenNLP Interpret: A Framework for Explaining Predictions of NLP Models: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09251.pdf" class="linkified">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09251.pdf</a>&lt;…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/266028254/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Distributed consensus, the ability to reach agreement in the face of failures and asynchrony, is a fundamental and powerful primitive for constructing reliable distributed systems from unreliable components. For over two decades, the Paxos algorithm has been synonymous with distributed consensus. Paxos is widely deployed in production systems, yet it is poorly understood and it proves to be heavyweight, unscalable and unreliable in practice.</p> <p>In this talk, we re-examine the foundations of how Paxos solves distributed consensus. Our hypothesis is that these limitations are not inherent to the problem of consensus but instead specific to the approach of Paxos. The surprising result of our analysis is a substantial weakening to the requirements of this widely studied algorithm. Building on this insight, we are able to prove an extensive generalization over the Paxos algorithm.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-935.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.c…</a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/265170390/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Although he started out writing C for embedded systems, these days he spends his time in Elixir, Go, and Rust. When not writing code for work, Chris can be found writing code for fun, talking about the joys of functional programming, playing pinball, roasting coffee, or building lego with his kids.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/262707246/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Following close on the heels of Jacob Kobernik’s thorough investigation of bitcoin, we will review the Zerocash whitepaper which picks up where all the anonymity concerns of bitcoin left off. Zerocash “provides a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees” by leveraging recent advancements in the zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (ZKSNARKs). This paper leads with a high level review of the shortcomings of bitcoin, investigates some alternatives utilizing the mixers and the Zerocoin protocol and then dives deep into the formulation and creation of Zerocash and ZKSNARKs.</p> <p>Bill Brock is the head of delivery at Very, a Chattanooga based web and mobile consultancy.

          <p>With the popularity of Bitcoin on the rise, the underlying technology is being constantly explained as it is dissected and evolved. The term “blockchain” has necessarily become a complex and dense entity when explaining the mechanics of cryptocurrencies.

They cover history of the blockchain as well as practical operation and current shortcomings in various implementations.</p> <p>Jacob Kobernik is backend Software Engineer at Skuid who likes to hang out with smart people in hopes that something rubs off.

          <p>In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work, the authors attempt to bridge the gap between supervised learning and unsupervised learning using CNNs.</p> <p>This paper introduces the concept of DCGANs, which are neural networks that are trained to distinguish interesting structures and meaning from raw image data by competing with one another. In particular, the networks that are presented appear to be a strong candidate set for unsupervised learning of features for use in realistic image generation.&gt;&gt;We’ll explore convincing evidence that the DCGAN pair used here learns a hierarchical representation of the features held within images ranging from objects to entire scenes. Additionally, we’ll explore the use of these learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as generic image…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/237702021/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Collecting real-time metrics like request latency is a critical part of production support. While it is easy to aggregate summary statistics like count, mean, and range, they are often a poor representation of actual service performance. This paper [1] describes a data structure that efficiently and accurately represents a histogram, which can be used to monitor and alert on quantile metrics (median, 99th percentile, etc.) in real time and constant space.</p> <p>Brent Spell is a programmer at OpenTable in Chattanooga, where he works on infrastructure for distributed systems and machine learning applications for restaurants.</p> <p>[1]: <a href="https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf">Computing Extremely Accurate Quantiles Using t-Digests</a></p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/bzdctlyvlbdb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>In <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/Subtyping/">Subtyping vs. Subclassing</a>, Oleg Kiselyov addresses the separation of interface and implementation. The first section shows that in good object oriented design, the type system can't be used in general to decide whether implementations can be safely substituted for one another. In <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/Subtyping/Preventing-Trouble.html">Preventing Trouble</a>, he outlines a set of rules (in C++) that do allow the type system to enforce subtype relationships, and that look suspiciously familiar.</p> <p>Lang Martin is a Principal Software Engineer at OpenTable and renown thought-leader in the hand gesture space.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/bzdctlyvkbhb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Building robust systems is an important part of software engineering. For various reasons, it's rarer than it should be. How can we improve as engineers to provide robust systems in a fast-paced environment?</p> <p>The wizard himself, Gerald Sussman, explores this topic by exploring how biological systems maintain functionality under the constant assault of everyday life. <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/robust-systems.pdf">Building Robust Systems</a> promises to be an interesting dive into two seemingly disparate worlds.</p> <p>The entrance on Cherry Street will probably be locked by the time we get setup. We have several different avenues for contacting us on <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/chattanooga">our PWL github</a> as well as being hooked into the Chadev slack. We'll also try and have someone at the door between 5:15 and 5:45 to let you in.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/gmtvslyvjbkb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

"Statistics for Engineers" surveys common statistical techniques for extracting useful, actionable information from the engineering data we regularly generate and encounter.</p> <p><b>About the Author:</b></p> <p><b>Heinrich Hartmann</b> is chief data scientist for Circonus. He earned his PhD in pure mathematics from the University of Bonn (Germany) on geometric aspects of string theory and worked as a researcher for the University of Oxford (UK) afterwards. In 2012 he transitioned into computer science and worked as an independent consultant for a number of different companies and research institutions.
