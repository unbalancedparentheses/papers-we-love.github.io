          <p>Mark will be talking about the family of algorithms known as MiniMax as applied to Artificial Intelligence. This is an old algorithm and there is no specific paper to read from. As references we can start with the wikipedia article on MiniMax: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" class="linkified">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax</a> and on the extended algorithm we will discuss called Alpha-Beta Pruning: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning" class="linkified">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning</a>.</p> <p>We will discuss these algorithms within the scope of 2 player grid games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Isolation. We will see how these algorithms are motivated by game theory, and how a good heuristic is important for making them work in the real world where we don’t have infinite compute resources.</p> <p>And hopefully we’ll have some show-and-tell with some computers and stuff pitting different algorithms against each…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/262947156/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Michael Schmidt will be presenting on "MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics" by Radford M. Neal from "Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo." Michael will help guide us through some terrifying equations to show how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo can make solving numerically difficult problems possible.</p> <p>From the abstract: "Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious “momentum” variables."</p> <p>You can see the paper here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1901.pdf" class="linkified">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1901.pdf</a></p> <p>For more information on other MCMC methods see the paper here: </p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/260518732/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Brian Kamusinga will be presenting on the paper "Chemometric Modeling of Coffee Sensory Notes through Their Chemical Signatures: Potential and Limits in Defining an Analytical Tool for Quality Control." You can see the abstract here: <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b01340" class="linkified">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b01340</a></p> <p>Who couldn't love a paper that starts off with an abstract like this: "Aroma is a primary hedonic aspect of a good coffee." The presentation will be mostly based on chemical sensors (Brian's area of interest). He will talk a little about how these work, and we'll learn how taste biosensors work as well. Brian's a great presenter, so be prepared to have fun and learn a lot even if you have no idea what chemistry is. And here's a bonus: if you're a coffee snob, I'm sure this talk will help you up your game to new levels of sophistication!</p> <p>Food this meetup will be sponsored by Capnion!

A better concept, I will argue, is representation learning, and this means approximately that feature engineering is integrated into the training process in an essential way. The linked paper was my original entree to this subject and it provides an example of representation learning which uses decision trees (as opposed to artificial neurons) as it's primitive building block. In my talk, I'll explain what representation learning is in more detail, argue that the algorithms called 'deep learning' are applications of representation learning via neur…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/250820022/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

This can be tongue in cheek or earnest.<br>3) "papers I hate" -- A paper you actually dislike, but please keep it lighthearted.</p> <p>We're removing the rule that you can't speak on a paper you published. If you want to lovingly bash your own work and think it would be fun for all then go for it.

          <p>A homomorphic encryption scheme is one that allows computations to be carried out on ciphertext.  The idea is the following: I have two integers a and b and I want to encrypt them in a special way, one that allows YOU to use ENCRYPT(a) and ENCRYPT(b) to compute a third value x such that DECRYPT(x) = a+b - in other words, you have computed a+b for me and I didn't even have to tell you what a or b were!  Such a scheme would have a great many applications but the quest to construct one was mostly fruitless until just a few years ago.</p> <p>In my talk, I'll start by explaining what a homomorphic encryption is, why the "fully" in my title is an important qualifier, and go into a few of the many reasons that homomorphic encryption is a big deal.  I will then talk a bit about recent progress in this area with specific focus on the  (linked) papers <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/616.pdf">Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers</a> and </p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/237047272/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

The major complexities arise from the uncertainties inherent in the system, particularly with regard to message delivery and possible faulty or unexpected behavior of processors. A protocol must be designed (and proved!) to function correctly even if it is possible for messages to be lost, for messages to arrive out of order, or for some processor to fail."</p> <p>Please note that we're at a new location this month: Ultralinq will be hosting us at 9666 Olive Blvd. in Olivette.

          <p>Arrow's impossibility theorem is the original, seminal example of a "voting paradox" that limits how "nicely" a method of producing a group decision from individual preferences (like voting) can behave.  Specifically, the theorem describes 4 properties that we'd all like our voting system to have and states that no voting system can have all these properties at once.</p> <p>The beauty of the theorem is how easily it can be tied to common frustrations of democratic politics.  I will start by giving a few historical examples of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (the most interesting of the aforementioned 4 properties) in action.  I will then give a simplified toy proof of the theorem posed via a game in which one voter does their best to troll another.  Finally, I will blast off into outer space and discuss esoteric and impractical topics like set theory and ultrafilter voting.   </p> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Wikipedia ar…</a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/230831412/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>This will start with a brief introduction to differential expression analysis. This is the approach of comparing gene expression in two or more tissue samples to compare the way genes are expressed in various conditions. This will cover the basic principle, caveats, and a couple different approaches. </p> <p>The second part will focus on one particular method for expression analysis, as developed by the Pachter Lab at UC Berkeley. They have used a newer method of assigning RNA-Seq reads to the correct locations of the genome. The RNA-Seq quantification is handled by the program kallisto, and the differential expression is performed by sleuth.</p> <p>Web Pages for the tools:</p> <p><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.html"></a><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.htm" class="linkified">http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.htm</a>l</p> <p><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/about.html"></a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/226155831/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Kyle Pointer will be presenting on Neal Koblitz's paper titled Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems. You can download a copy of the paper <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~liljanab/MATH508/KoblitzEmbedding.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p>--- </p> <p>A message from Kyle Pointer:</p> <p>Anyone who is interested in better understanding some of the math behind this paper might be interested in the book Algebraic Aspects of Cryptography[1], also written by Neal Koblitz. It contains a LOT of background that is useful in understanding the paper. Many of the details that are left out of the paper are covered somewhere in this relatively short text. </p> <p>And, for the true math heroes among you who, I can suggest you check out Koblitz's Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms[2].</p> <p>AND, just in case you want to have a book that your friends will think covers an oddly specific topic, Alex (who was at our last meeting) suggested the book Rational Points on Elliptic Curves[3] to me, and I've …</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/222627742/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Excerpt from Kevin:</p> <p>Yes the title sounds all biologyish-chemistryish but it's really a theoretical biology paper, which mostly means building fairly simple mathematical models of physical processes (with some numerical simulations). Parts of it are mathematically challenging but those parts can be glossed over without missing much.</p> <p>If you look at the paper and it's too scary, don't worry. I'll do my best to explain what I love about this paper, but maybe you can read this 2-page review?
