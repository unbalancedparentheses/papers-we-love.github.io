You're out minding your own business, when a highwayman brandishes a large floppy disk and demands, "How would you design a file compression format? You have 30 seconds to answer!"</p> <p>This talk will prepare you for that moment.</p> <p>We'll cover the basic stuff that goes into file compression formats, such as gzip and zstd, so that you understand what they actually do. Topics include Lempel-Ziv algorithms, Huffman and arithmetic coding, dictionary management, and preprocessing input data, with digressions about character encodings, serializing integers, and practical file format design.</p> <p>What's out of scope? Image, audio, and lossy compression.</p> <p>After attending, you should be able to make a half-decent compression format.</p> <p>Papers (not required reading):<br>- RFC-1951: deflate (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951" class="linkified">htt…</a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/pmgxbqyzpbkb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>"The Properties and Promises of UTF-8", by Martin J. Dürst (1997).</p> <p>Presented by Marvin Humphrey.</p> <p>OVERVIEW:</p> <p>Created by Ken Thompson one night in September 1992 on a placemat in a New Jersey diner, UTF-8 is a spectacular quintuple bank shot of design: optimal across so many criteria that it's hard to believe anybody could pull it off.</p> <p>Over the years, UTF-8 has increasingly eclipsed all of the alternatives. UTF-1 and UTF-7 are obsolete and only of historical interest; UTF-32 has limited practical utility; UCS-2 can't express all of Unicode... the only serious competitor remaining is UTF-16, but UTF-8 has continued to gain market share.</p> <p>In 1997, Martin J. Dürst gave a talk at the 11th International Unicode Conference in San Jose on "The Properties and Promises of UTF-8". Two decades later at Papers We Love San Diego, we will review those marvelous properties and contemplate all of the promises that UTF-8 has fulfilled.</p> <p>DOWNLOAD:</p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/pmgxbqyxpbcb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>"Differential Privacy", by Cynthia Dwork (2006).</p> <p>Presented by Mike Mull.</p> <p>ABSTRACT:</p> <p>In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius’ goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very h…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/pmgxbqyxnbgb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>"On Data Banks and Privacy Homomorphisms", by Rivest, Adleman, and Dertouzos (1978).</p> <p>Presented by Nate Gentile.</p> <p>Abstract: Encryption is a well-known technique for preserving the privacy of sensitive information. One of the basic, apparently inherent, limitations of this technique is that an information system working with encrypted data can at most store or retrieve the data for the user; any more complicated operations seem to require that the data be decrypted before being operated on. This limitation follows from the choice of encryption functions used, however, and although there are some truly inherent limitations on what can be accomplished, we shall see that it appears likely that there exist encryption functions which permit encrypted data to be operated on without preliminary decryption of the operands, for many sets of interesting operations. These special encryption functions we call "privacy homomorphisms"...</p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/pwbzkmyxmbjb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

The implementation of such a system requires to handle lots of situations depending on the operations performed by users on files, and it is thus difficult to ensure that all the corner cases have been correctly addressed. Here, instead of verifying the implementation of such a system, we adopt a complementary approach: we introduce a theoretical model, which is defined abstractly by the universal property that it should satisfy, and work out a concrete description of it. We begin by defining a category of files and patches, where the operation of merging the effe…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/pwbzkmyxhbfb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-pla…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/pwbzkmyxgbhb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Various algorithms have been proposed in the past, and the HyperLogLog algorithm is one of them. In this paper, we present a series of improvements to this algorithm that reduce its memory requirements and significantly increase its accuracy for an important range of cardinalities. We have implemented our proposed algorithm for a system at Google and evaluated it empirically, c…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/pwbzkmywnbhb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Xerox PARC in the 1970s was a legendary hothouse of innovation, producing such technological marvels as the laser printer, Ethernet, "object-oriented programming" (as a coherent paradigm)... and the world's first GUI workstation: the Xerox Alto.</p> <p>The vision which led to the Alto is most fully laid out in the 1977 magazine article "Personal Dynamic Media", which describes the "interim Dynabook", a prototype laptop.  The article captures a moment of rapid evolution in how humans interact with computers, describing nascent forms of many now-ubiquitous GUI applications, anticipating the PC revolution of the 1980s -- and offering insight into what made PARC so special and how we might replicate aspects of the PARC environment today.</p> <p><i><a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m1977001_dynamedia.pdf">Personal Dynamic Media</a></i> by Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg.</p> <p>Presented by Marvin Humphrey.</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues <i>north</i> of B Street is usuall…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/pwbzkmywkbjb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

It provides strong consistency for all transactions. This combination of availability and consistency over the wide area is generally considered impossible due to the CAP Theorem. We show how Spanner achieves this combination and why it is consistent with CAP. We also explore the role that TrueTime, Google's globally synchronized clock, plays in consistency for reads and especially for snapshots that enable consistent and repeatable analytics.</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues <i>north</i> of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

However, there’s much more to monoids than meets the eye. Using examples taken from the diagrams vector graphics framework as a case study, I demonstrate the power and beauty of monoids for library design. The paper begins with an extremely simple model of diagrams and proceeds through a series of incremental variations, all related somehow to the central theme of monoids. Along the way, I illustrate the power of compositional semantics; why you should also pay attention to the monoid’s even humbler cousin, the semigroup; monoid homomorphisms; and monoid actions…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/events/236660045/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
