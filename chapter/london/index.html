In this talk, we'll celebrate its birthday, by going through the initial paper by Satoshi Nakamoto. We will explain the main principles behind the idea, explain the basic design decisions and implementation details and how it deals with several problems. We will conclude the session by looking back at history and retrospecting on the implications of some of these design decisions.</p> <p>The Speaker</p> <p>Dimos has an MEng in Eletrical and Computer Enginee…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/258060947/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Ever since computing moved on from directly entering numerical opcodes, we have had increasingly free rein to design for the humans more than the machines.

          <p>What happened in the basements of the AI lab at MIT in the late '50 is truly inspiring and this paper is telling us that story. Herbert Stoyan spent many years researching those early days and even McCarthy is pointing at his work in his papers!</p> <p>Lisp is one of the oldest languages out there. When I started learning about functional programming, I got interested in why Lisp languages are what they are today, what's the relationship with AI, what lambda calculus has to do with this, or why I kept hearing things like "Lisp has failed".</p> <p>Surprisingly, many concepts that we give for granted in functional programming today were there almost 60 years ago! </p> <p>The paper is quite accessible and a good start for the new season of PWL. Some Lisp sources will be presented but there is no need to have a deep knowledge of the language.

Finally, a breakthrough came by sharing ideas from category theory to bring monads into functional programming, as a way to model and manage side effects. However, little has been done to ensure that entire interaction sequences <i>make sense</i>. For example, many functional programming languages will allow you to open a file handle, close it, and then try and read from it - clearly a nonsensical sequence of operations! In "Kleisli Arrows of Outrageous Fortune", Conor McBride shows us how we can borrow more ideas from the literature, introducing a new formulation of <i>indexed monads</i> - a structure with close connections to slice categories. Given these new tools, he demonstrates that these monads can correspond to enforcin…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/222094026/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>Equal Rights for Functional Objects, or, The More Things Change, the More they Stay the Same</b></p> <p>There are many ways of defining equality, particularly in a language which has both object-oriented and functional aspects. There's reference equality, numerical equality, shallow list equality, deep list equality, string equality, and even "fuzzy" floating-point equality. Which is the right to choose in any given situation? Which should i use for my equals() method on my custom object?</p> <p>This paper answers all of these questions, by taking a seemingly complex problem and revealing an underlying simplicity. It does this by defining one equality operation that works in any situation.</p> <p>The paper makes use of lisp syntax, but the ideas are applicable to most modern languages.</p> <p>Can anyone sponsor pizza and drinks? Makes it much easier for me to host more things at uSwitch if someone else covers the food.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/170910742/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
