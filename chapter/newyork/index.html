<p><img alt="Papers We Love NYC" src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/0/0/600_358182752.jpeg" /> What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</p>

<p>As the original Papers We Love chapter, we've been helping New Yorkers scratch their paper reading itch for most of 2014. We welcome everyone from the programming community for an evening of ideas, vibrant discussions and hanging out with your fellow travellers.</p>

<p>The <strong>New York Chapter</strong> meets monthly at different locations throughout the city. Keep an eye on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/">Meetup.com</a> page to find out the latest address.</p>

<p><strong>Our meets fill up fast</strong>, so please make sure to RSVP only if you plan on attending. You can find our schedule and RSVP <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/">here on Meetup.com</a>.</p>

<p>Papers We Love has a <strong><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a></strong>. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!</p>

          <p>We are excited to host Sun-Li Beatteay speaking on Guaranteeing Consensus in Distributed Systems with CRDTs</p> <p>Talk:</p> <p>Consensus in distributed systems has been a debated topic every since programmers discovered they could run the same program on multiple machines. Researchers have been studying consensus for decades, resulting in numerous algorithms and white papers. Unfortunately, many of these algorithms are flawed and unreliabled.</p> <p>However, in 2011, a team of researchers published a paper on a novel approach to distributed consensus using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (<a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00609399v1/document" class="linkified">https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00609399v1/document</a>). This paper created quite a buzz as it showed that CRDTs were mathematically proven to guarantee consensus through "Strong Eventual Consistency." They also claimed to have solved the CAP conundrum.</p> <p>This presentation dives into this seminal paper in order to answ…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/259743812/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

It turns out that there’s an elegant, divide-and-conquer approach that utilizes a nifty trick. Jon Luis Bentley, a pioneer in the space of geometric algorithms, proposes this solution (and answers many more problems) in his original PhD thesis, written in 1976. The talk will focus in on his solution to the closest-pair problem, then discuss some general approaches to algorithm construction that he outlined when defending his thesis... all written with a type-writer.</p> <p>Elijah is a quantitative software engineer at T…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/256220927/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Cardwell, et. al.</p> <p><b>Talk</b></p> <p>TCP congestion control has a large impact on perceived network performance (especially in terms of bandwidth and latency) and thus the Internet. Two major categories of congestion control algorithms had been explored, those using packet loss or packet delay feedback. Due to historic developments (and the development of packet switching hardware), packet-loss congestion control algorithms are commonly used today. We will discuss a congestion control scheme published by Google in 2017.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><i>Hannes Frederic Sowa</i> recently joined <a href="http://backtrace.io">backtrace.io</a>, and is onsite in Ne…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/246848117/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

As programs have grown in size and complexity, so have the systems that manage garbage collection. Each algorithm makes a different set of tradeoffs between factors such as the space used by objects, the space used by bookkeeping, the number of unused objects (garbage) that remain uncollected, the time spent in allocation, and the time spent in<br>collection.</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/220081725/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars. While testing provides some assurance, it is difficult to test all possibilities in complex systems--and practically impossible in concurrent systems. For the critical systems in our lives, we should demand mathematical guarantees that the software behaves the way the programmer expected.</p> <p>A single paper influenced much of the work towards providing these mathematical guarantees.

This enables language designers to focus on features without worrying about the complexities of compiler optimizations and code generation. This paper presents a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that allows the application to control the JIT compiler behavior at runtime.

We're all familiar with routing problems, such as the recent <a href="http://news.rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-annotated">RapGenius incident</a>. It turns out that simple improvements to randomized routing can dramatically improve the performance! Sparrow is a distributed scheduling algorithm for low latency, high throughput workloads. We'll review the Sparrow algorithm, and learn the tricks that they used.

"Programing with Algebraic Effects and Handlers" is the later sort of great paper. After two decades of fundamental research in to the nature of computation, a lot of mysterious ideas in computer science such as continuations and exception handling finally made sense to a number of mathematically inclined geniuses. Bauer and Pretnar's Eff programming language cuts right through the heart of the theory in a way that makes sense to anybody who has ever written a functional program. This paper uses the Eff language to explore…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/168722902/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
