<p><img alt="Papers We Love Athens" src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/b/8/highres_466715256.jpeg" /> What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss in a low ego, friendly environment.</p>

<p>We'll be using <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/athens">our chapter's repository</a> for organising our meetups
and accepting presentation proposals.</p>
