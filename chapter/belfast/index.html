<p><img alt="Papers We Love Belfast" src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/2/8/highres_455261256.jpeg" /> What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</p>

<p>The <strong>Belfast Chapter</strong> meets every 2-3 months at different locations throughout the city, and has been runninng since October 2016. Keep an eye on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-Belfast/">Meetup.com</a> page to find out the latest address.</p>

          <p>To mark our first year of running these events in Belfast, we have a bumper multiple speaker event! This time we're very pleased to welcome Keith Maxwell presenting "<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring17/cos333/knuth-mcilroy.pdf">A Literal Program</a>" and Russell Matbouli presenting "<a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf">A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public Key Cryptosystems</a>". We'll also have a short presentation from Paddy Carey reporting back from his time at PWLConf in St. Louis!</p> <p><i>A Literal Program</i></p> <p>Last month‘s column introduced Don Knuth’s style of “Literate Programming” and his WEB system for building programs that are works of literature. This column presents a literate program by Knuth (its origins are sketched in last month‘s column) and, as befits literature, a review. So without further ado, here is Knuth’s program, retypeset in Communications style. </p> <p><i>A Method for Obtaining Dig…</i></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Belfast/events/243093533/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

This time, we're delighted to welcome Michael Jason Smith presenting a Research at Google paper, &lt;a&gt;Idle Time Garbage Collection Scheduling&lt;/a&gt;!</p> <p><i>Abstract</i></p> <p>Efficient garbage collection is increasingly important in today’s managed language runtime systems that demand low latency, low memory consumption, and high throughput. Garbage collection may pause the application for many milliseconds to identify live memory, free unused memory, and compact fragmented regions of memory, even when employing concurrent garbage collection. In animation-based applications that require 60 frames per second, these pause times may be observable, degrading user experience. This paper introduces idle time garbage collection scheduling to increase the responsiveness of applications by hiding expensive garbage collection operations inside of small, otherwise unused idle portions of t…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Belfast/events/240506364/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Happy New Year, paper fans! For our first PWL Belfast event of 2017 sponsored by HighWire Press, we're very happy to have Phil Weir presenting a talk titled <a href="https://maths.ucd.ie/~plynch/Publications/WPNP-Foreword.pdf">20 May 1910: LF Richardson and the Dawn of Simulation</a>.</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>Accurate weather forecasts based on computer simulation are now produced as a routine, and have reached such a level of reliability that the rare forecast failures evoke a strong reaction in the media and amongst users. Numerical simulation of an ever-increasing range of geophysical phenomena is adding enormously to our understanding of complex processes in the Earth system. The consequences for mankind of ongoing climate change will be far-reaching. Earth System Models are capable of replicating climate regimes of past millennia and are the best means we have of predicting the future of our climate. </p> <p>Details</p> <p>Doors open at 6.30 pm and the presentation will begin at 7…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Belfast/events/236666972/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>For our very first Papers We Love Belfast we're delighted to have Paddy Carey presenting <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft</a>, a distributed consensus algorithm!</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.</p> <p>Details</p> <p>Doors open …</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Belfast/events/234379377/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
