<p><img alt="Papers We Love Porto" src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/d/0/f/highres_468847439.jpeg" /> What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</p>

<p>As a Papers We Love chapter we welcome everyone from the programming community for an evening of ideas, vibrant discussions and hanging out with your fellow travellers.</p>

<p>The <strong>Porto Chapter</strong> meets monthly at different locations throughout the city. Keep an eye on our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-porto">Meetup.com</a> page to find out the latest address.</p>

<p>Please make sure to RSVP before attending to make it easier for us to organize all correctly. You can find our schedule and RSVP <a href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-porto/">here on Meetup.com</a>.</p>

<p>Papers We Love has a <strong><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love-porto/organization/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a></strong>. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!</p>

However, due to its complexity, it usually takes a long time and a lot of computational resources to train deeper neural networks. Deep Residual networks (ResNets), can make the training process easier, faster and even allow to build deeper networks. In this presentation we will take a look on how ResNets work and the breakthroughs they allowed to make in the world of computer vision.</p> <p>Details</p> <p>Doo…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Porto/events/cmmfnqyzdbzb/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

You do P2P! I created a distributed smart office using Elixir that runs in a single P2P network. There are a lot of subtleties into this. How can we prevent someone from entering the network? How do we manage shared data? What topology do we use? How about nodes that are unrealiable and we are not sure when they will connect or disconnect? What if YOU want to add a node and we can't trust you to deliver messages? I will use the office as an example and teach you how different the reasoning between a web-like centralised context and a P2P distributed system is.

In order to select the storage engine that is appropriate for your application, you need to have a rough idea of what the storage engine is doing under the hood.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll discuss and examine some core data structures such as Hash Indexes, SSTables, LSM-Trees, and B-Trees, that are used in the traditional relational databases and NoSQL databas…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Porto/events/248728411/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
